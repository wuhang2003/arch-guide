<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     intended for use by those authorized to give the public</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     licensed material, or material used under an exception or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     the licensor&#39;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     the licensed material may still be restricted for other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     reasons, including because others have copyright or other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>  a. License grant.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               in part; and</span></span>

<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               under the conditions of the Adapter&#39;s License You apply.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>               Material.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>

<span class="line"><span>          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>  b. Other rights.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          Rights, but not otherwise.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          reserves any right to collect such royalties.</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>     conditions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>     Licensor.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
